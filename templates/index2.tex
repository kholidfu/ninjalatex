  manual are expected to at least know general safety procedures.

  the vehicle or render it unsafe. It is also important to understand
  that the ``Warnings'' and ``Cautions'' are not exhaustive. It is
  impossible to warn of all the hazardous consequences that might
  result from failure to follow the procedures.
